Without understanding computers and how they are programmed, much of the world will increasingly seem like magic, and you will be at its mercy.\n</li>\n<li>\nBeing able to program provides personal empowerment.<br/>\nTwenty years ago, Steve Jobs famously talking about computers as bicycles for the mind.  Today, computers are far more powerful and connected worldwide --- super-tanker-sized hypersonic spaceships of the mind.  Without learning to program, you can still ride them if you are willing to remove your shoes at the security checkpoint and go where the pilot wants to go, but if you want to be the one flying you need to learn about programming.\n</li>\n<li>\nComputing opens the door to some of the best jobs in the world, and enables almost everyone to do their job better.<br/>\nLast year, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/fast-growing-jobs/1.html\">Money Magazine</a> reported that Software Developer as the #1 job for fast growth (#7 is IT Consultant). The <a href=\"http://www.sdtimes.com/link/35710\">SD Times</a> reported that computer science majors received more job offers than any other major.  <a href=\"http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/10-best-jobs-2011\">CareerCast</a> reports \"Software Engineer, a job that involves the design and creation of software for everything from operating systems to cell phone \"apps\" to interactive games, ranks as the best job of 2011.\"\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q2\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat programming language does the course use?\n</b><br/>\nWe will be using Python (Version 2.6). Python is a great language for learning to program since it simple and easy to get started in, but it is also powerful enough to be widely used for building web sites (including Google), performing scientific computation, and creating games. The concepts we cover in the class are not specific to Python, but apply to computer science in general no matter what programming language you are using.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q3\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nIs there a course textbook?\n</b><br/>\nThere is no required textbook for the course, and the course content does not follow any textbook. There are many books available on Python programming that may be helpful to students. For a comprehensive list of resources targeting new programmers, check out <a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers\">Python for Non-Programmers</a> .\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q4\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nCan you really build a search engine in seven weeks?\n</b><br/>\nYou can, and we'll show you how! The core components of a search engine are surprisingly simple, and with a language as concise as Python, the entire program is only about one page of code. You will write key parts of this code yourself, and should completely understand the full search engine code by the end of the course.\n</p>\n<p>\nOver the first three units, we will build a web crawler, which is a program that collects content from web pages to use in the search engine. In unit 4, we'll build an index to be able to respond to queries.  In unit 5, we'll make the index fast enough that it could scale to a large collection of pages. In unit 6, we'll implement a method for finding the best page for a search query, similar to the way Google ranks pages.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q5\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nAre there homework assignments?\n</b><br/>\nYes. To learn computer science, it is important to solve progressively more challenging problems on your own, so there will be six homework assignments, one at the end of each unit. There are no due dates for the homeworks.  The homework assignments will be similar to the in-class quizzes and mostly cover material from that week's unit, except the homework assignments will include larger problems for you to solve on your own.  You will receive instant feedback on these questions and can try them as many times as you like.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q6\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nHow do I get help?\n</b><br/>\n<!-- If your question relates to a particular quiz or lecture clip, you can comment below the video.  -->\nWe love to see an active academic community, so we encourage you to post your question to the <a href=\"http://forums.udacity.com/cs101-april2012\">forum</a>.

There will be at least two opportunities to take an exam for this course. \nOne after about 7 weeks and the other approximately 8 weeks later.</p><p>\nThe next exam will be available at 23:59 UTC on 27th May 2012. \nYou will have one week to complete the exam. You may submit your answers as many times as you like, \nbut you will receive no feedback until after the closing date. The closing date for the exam is 23:59 UTC\non 3rd June 2012. No submissions will be accepted after this time.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q10\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nHow will my final grade be determined?\n</b><br/>\nYour final grade will be determined by your exam grade.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q11\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat are the rules on collaboration?\n</b><br/>\nWorking with other students is often the best way to learn new things, and we hope students in the class will form vibrant communities, both on-line and in-person, to help each other learn.  The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them.  \n</p>\n<p>\nYou are welcome (and encouraged) to view the lectures with others, and discuss and work together on answering the in-lecture quizzes.  For the homeworks, you may discuss the questions with other students in the on-line forums and in-person study groups, but everything you submit should be your own work.  For the final exam, you are not permitted to work with anyone else, and should only ask clarification questions on the on-line forums which will be answered by the course staff.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q12\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nDo I need to download Python on my computer?\n</b><br/>\nYou do not need to download Python to take the course, as we provide all the necessary tools right in your browser.

The technologies involved are cutting edge, but the theories behind them are simpler than you might think. In addition to learning the math and science behind these technologies, you will also improve your coding probabilities as you solve the same problems that scientists at places like Google, Stanford, and MIT have been working on for years. Having these skills will not only be personally fulfilling, but could have benefits to your professional life as well. Taking this course is the first step that you can take towards creating a world where every car on the road drives itself. If you love learning or just hate traffic, this course is for you.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q3\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat programming language does the course use?\n</b><br/>\nWe will be using Python (Version 2.6).

There are many books available on probability, linear algebra, and Python programming that may be helpful to students.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q6\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nAre there homework assignments?\n</b><br/>\nYes, there are six homework assignments, one at the end of each unit. To learn anything, but especially a subject as diverse as programming a robotic car, it is necessary to solve progressively more challenging problems on your own, and the homeworks will give you an opportunity to use what you have learned and develop your programming skills. The homework assignments will be similar to the in-class quizzes and mostly cover material from that week's unit, except the homework assignments will include larger problems for you to solve on your own.  \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q7\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nIs there a final exam?\n</b><br/>\nYes.

The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them.  \n</p>\n<p>\nYou are welcome (and encouraged) to view the lectures with others, and discuss and work together on answering the in-lecture quizzes.  For the homeworks, you may discuss the questions with other students in the on-line forums and in-person study groups, but everything you submit should be your own work.  For the final exam, you are not permitted to work with anyone else, and should only ask clarification questions on the on-line forums which will be answered by the course staff.\n</p>\n</div>", "isPremiere": false, "image_url": "http://lh3.ggpht.com/38Q8ciw-5kOTu0LH5eXSMstvUUN2L5AXLIGp9UU1Mb7Jt9Cs2pmbp1RHImk3UQBO19EMhCumco1CR9l_nA", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "path": "Course/cs373", "course_id": "CS373", "is_public": true, "type": "Course", "id": "cs373", "tags": {"addedSubjects": [""], "difficulty": "Advanced", "subjects": ["Computer Science"], "misc": [], "baseSubject": "Computer Science"}, "description": "Learn how to program all the major systems of a robotic car from the leader of Google and Stanford's autonomous driving teams.
